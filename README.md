Hello, Guys
I created this repository to allocate the solution to the problem you gave me.
I'll include the steps below on how to execute the automation code.


We'll need to download and install:
1. Python 
2. ChromeDriver
3. RobotFramework
4. SeleniumLibrary
5. Screenshot Library


**1. Pyhton**
   Enter this link to do the download
   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3-amd64.exe
   Open the file to install
   Just do the normal installation

**2. ChromeDriver**
   Check for your Chrome browser version and download the proper chromedriver version
   https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
   Extract the files, copy the chromedriver.exe and throw it into the Disk:\Users\"UserName"\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\

**3. RobotFramework**
   Open the CMD
   paste the following command and press enter -> pip install --upgrade robotframework

Now, clone the repository
